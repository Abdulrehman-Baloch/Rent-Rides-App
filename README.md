# RentRides - JavaFX Vehicle Rental System  

## Project Overview  
- RentRides is a JavaFX-based vehicle rental application designed to provide a seamless and affordable platform for renting cars and bikes.  
- The system connects renters with rental companies, ensuring secure reservations, reliable transactions, and an intuitive user experience.  
- The project is built using Java for the backend and JavaFX for the frontend with PostgreSQL as the database.  

## Features Implemented  
- User Registration and Authentication: Renters and rental companies can sign up and log in securely.  
- Browse Vehicles: Users can search, filter, and view available cars and bikes.  
- Make Reservations: Renters can book vehicles and request a driver if needed.  
- Secure Payment Processing: Integrated payment gateway for handling transactions.  
- Vehicle Management: Rental companies can add, update, and remove vehicles from the system.  
- Reservation Management: Companies can approve, modify, or cancel reservations.  
- Vehicle Return and Feedback: Renters can return vehicles and submit feedback.  
- Customer Support: Users can contact support for rental-related inquiries.  

## Technologies Used  

### Frontend  
- JavaFX (FXML, CSS)  

### Backend  
- Java (Object-Oriented Programming)  

### Database  
- PostgreSQL  

### Build Tool  
- Maven or Gradle  

### Version Control  
- GitHub  

### Payment Integration  
- Placeholder for future implementation  

## System Design  

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
- Users: Represents renters and rental company accounts.  
- Vehicles: Stores information about available rental vehicles.  
- Reservations: Tracks booking details, including date, vehicle, renter, and payment status.  
- Payments: Logs all transactions related to reservations.  

### Key Components  
- The system follows the Model-View-Controller pattern for modularity.  

### Database Schema  
- users (userID, name, email, password, role)  
- vehicles (vehicleID, model, type, availability, rentalPrice)  
- reservations (reservationID, userID, vehicleID, startDate, endDate, status)  
- payments (paymentID, reservationID, amount, paymentStatus)  

## Implementation Details  

### User Authentication and Registration  
- Renters and rental companies can register and log in securely.  
- Passwords are stored securely using hashing techniques.  

### Vehicle Management  
- Rental companies can add and update vehicle details, including rental rates and availability.  

### Reservation System  
- Renters can reserve a vehicle and optionally request a driver.  
- The system checks vehicle and driver availability before confirming the booking.  

### Payment Integration  
- The payment module ensures secure transactions.  

### Notifications and Confirmation  
- Users receive booking confirmations and payment receipts.  

## Testing and Results  

### Test Cases  
- User Registration: Successfully registers a new user  
- Login Authentication: Grants access with correct credentials  
- Vehicle Availability Check: Displays only available vehicles  
- Reservation Processing: Successfully creates a reservation  
- Payment Processing: Handles payments securely  

## Challenges and Learnings  

### Challenges  
- Implementing secure authentication and authorization for renters and rental companies  
- Ensuring real-time updates in vehicle availability after a reservation is made  
- Managing dependencies and configurations for JavaFX in different IDEs  

### Learnings  
- Gained experience in integrating JavaFX UI with backend logic  
- Improved understanding of database management and SQL queries  
- Enhanced troubleshooting skills for JavaFX styling and scene transitions  

## Future Enhancements  
- Develop an Android or iOS version using JavaFX or another framework  
- Implement OAuth for authentication and add SSL encryption for data protection  
- Support multiple payment gateways such as PayPal or Stripe  
- Integrate GPS tracking and live location features for drivers  
- Allow renters to leave feedback and ratings for vehicles and drivers  

## How to Use the Project  

### Clone the Repository  
- Run the following command in a terminal or Git Bash  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RentRides.git
cd RentRides
```

### Set Up JavaFX in Your IDE  
- Install JavaFX SDK from GluonHQ  
- Configure JavaFX libraries in IntelliJ or Eclipse  

### Configure the Database  
- Install PostgreSQL and create the database  
- Execute schema.sql to set up tables  
- Update database-config.properties with credentials  

### Run the Application
